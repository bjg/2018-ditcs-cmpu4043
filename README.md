## CMPU4043 Rich Web Application Technologies 2018-19 Official Repository

### The work and submission workflow is as follows:

- Before you start working on your lab worksheets for this module you must fork a copy of this official class repo
- Then clone the forked repo to your development machine
- For each separate worksheet, make a new branch in your cloned, local repo named as follows: __student-id__-wks-__worksheet-number__ where __student-id__ is something like C12345678 and __worksheet-number__ is 1, 2, 3, etc
- When you are finished developing your worksheet solution then you must push your local repo to the remote origin for that branch 
- Finally, when you are submitting your solution for grading, you will generate a pull request (PR) requesting that your branc is merged with the remote origin master branch of the official class repo above
- If you are not sure about any of the described steps here, then take a look at this worked demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQsBmnZvBdc
