Exercise 1:
A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result. It is not a data structure, it takes input from the collections, arrays or I/O channels. They don’t change the original data structure, they only provide a result from a pipe method. Some streams include map, filter and sorted. An observable is an object which notifies observers about the change in its state.

forEach: The forEach method is used to iterate through every element of the stream.

reduce: The reduce method is used to reduce the elements of a stream to a single value.

collect: The collect method is used to return the result of the intermediate operations performed on the stream.

map: The map method is used to map the items in the collection to other objects according to the Predicate passed as argument.

filter: The filter method is used to select elements as per the Predicate passed as argument.

sorted: The sorted method is used to sort the stream.


Exercise 2:

The RxJS library to handle asynchronous network responses to API requests by making an observer able to handle the event like so 

let userClicksSearchButton = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(
        $("#search-button"),
        'click'
    )
    .map((event) => {
        return $("#search-box").val();
    });

userClicksSearchButton
    .flatMap((searchTerm) => {
        return Rx.Observable.fromPromise(
            $.get('https://api.github.com/users/' + searchTerm)
        );
    })
    .subscribe((response) => {
        renderUser(
            response.login,
            response.html_url,
            response.avatar_url
        );
    });

function renderUser(login, href, imgSrc) {
    let searchResult = $("#search-result");
    searchResult.show();
    searchResult.attr("href", href);
    $("#search-result__avatar").attr('src', imgSrc);
    $('#search-result__login').text(login);
}

Benefits: 
Allows us to flatten all of those promise resolutions into a single observable stream, and when we subscribe to it

Disadvantages:
Bad naming conventions make it hard to learn like falsePromises being used instead of the map function
