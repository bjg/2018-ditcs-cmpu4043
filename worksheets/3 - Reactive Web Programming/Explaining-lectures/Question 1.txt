Question:	Explain what is meant by the stream abstraction. 
			What is the relationship between streams and the observer pattern?  
			What are streams useful for modeling and when might you use them in 
			Rich Web development?
			
Answer:	

Streams are an abstraction (general idea) used to model asynchronous data sources.
The general idea is that you can request more than one thing in a sequence. Whenever
you ask for another one, you'll get another one, until they all run out. (like water stream)
Each element in the stream is positioned according to what time it was added.

The observer pattern is to define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that
when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

The relationship between streams and the observer pattern is that streams use the
observer pattern to notify dependent objects of any change in state. The substribe()
method is used to facilitate this.

Streams come in handy during rich web development in the event of processing keyboard
input, mouse clicks, network responses, timers etcetera.
